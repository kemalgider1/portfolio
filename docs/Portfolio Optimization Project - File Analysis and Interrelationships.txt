1. Core Code Files Evolution
2023 Base Code (2023_code_vVP.py)

Primary analysis file using SQL Server database
Implements core portfolio optimization logic:

SKU performance analysis
Margin calculations
Growth metrics
Cluster analysis


Uses VP Data Mart as the data source
Includes comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning steps

2024 Snowflake Version (2024_code_vSF.py)

Updated version adapted for Snowflake database
Maintains similar logic structure but with optimized queries
Key improvements:

Enhanced data processing efficiency
Better handling of large datasets
Improved error handling
More robust connection management


Uses updated scoring methodology

Jeju-Specific Analysis (2023_jeju_code_vVP.py)

Specialized version for Jeju market analysis
Contains market-specific modifications:

Custom clustering parameters
Location-specific filters
Modified scoring weights


Serves as a template for other market-specific analyses

2. Data Structure Files
Snowflake PRD Mapping (Snowflake_PRD_mapping.xlsx)

Maps data structures between old and new databases
Critical for database migration
Contains:

Table relationships
Column mappings
Data type conversions
Key constraints



Queries.docx

Central repository of SQL queries
Contains both SQL Server and Snowflake versions
Key query categories:

Base queries for SKU data
Performance metrics calculations
Clustering analysis
Volume and revenue analysis


Serves as translation guide between platforms

3. Results and Analysis Files
2023 All Results (2023_all_results_compiled.xlsx)

Comprehensive results from 2023 analysis
Includes:

SKU performance metrics
Market analysis
Clustering results
Scoring outcomes



Sample Compiled Pickles 2024 (sample_compiled_pkls_2024.xlsx)

Contains preprocessed data for 2024 analysis
Improved data structure for faster processing
Includes intermediate calculation results

EDA Report (EDA_Report_allv2.txt)

Detailed exploratory data analysis
Statistical summaries
Data quality assessments
Distribution analyses

Key Version Differences (2023 vs 2024):

Database Changes:
pythonCopy# 2023 SQL Server Connection
conn = msql.connect(driver='{SQL Server}', 
                   server='vapafpdf_db.tdisf-prd.eu-west-1.aws.private-pmideep.biz,49600', 
                   database='VP_DataMart',
                   trusted_connection='yes')

# 2024 Snowflake Connection
conn2 = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user="USER",
    account="pl47603.eu-west-1",
    authenticator="externalbrowser",
    warehouse='WH_PRD_REPORTING',
    role='PMI_EDP_SPK_SNFK_PMI_FDF_PRD_DATAANALYST_IMDL',
    database = "DB_FDF_PRD"
)
Query Optimizations:
sqlCopy-- 2023 Version
SELECT a.Market as DF_Market, a.Location, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN [Year] = 2023 THEN Volume ELSE 0 END) AS '2023 Volume'
FROM VDM_Prices a

-- 2024 Version
SELECT trim(DF_MARKET_NAME) as "DF_Market", 
       trim(LOCATION_NAME) as "Location",
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR_NUM = 2024 THEN VOLUME ELSE 0 END) AS "2024 Volume"
FROM DB_FDF_PRD.CS_COMMRCL.RSP_FACT_RSP_CALC a

Analysis Integration:

Base Analysis:

Uses core code files for general processing
Applies standard scoring methodology
Generates baseline results


Market-Specific Analysis:

Uses Jeju code as template
Customizes parameters for local markets
Integrates with base analysis results


Results Compilation:

Combines outputs from all analyses
Validates against business rules
Generates final recommendations



Critical Notes for Future Reference:

Database Migration Considerations:


Always refer to Snowflake_PRD_mapping.xlsx for proper field mappings
Use updated query syntax from Queries.docx
Verify data types during transformations


Code Maintenance:


Keep core logic consistent between versions
Document market-specific modifications
Maintain query optimization records


Results Validation:


Cross-reference with historical data
Verify scoring consistency
Document anomalies and explanations
