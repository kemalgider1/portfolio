## Critical Success Factors

The dramatic performance gap with similar sales volumes demonstrates that total market opportunity is not the determining factor of portfolio success. Instead:

1. **Premium Mix & Strategic SKU Selection**: Lima's portfolio maintains higher margins and better product mix despite having similar number of SKUs.

2. **Segment Coverage & Competitive Positioning** (Category B): Lima's perfect 9.99 score vs Helsinki's 0.00 shows significantly better competitive product selection.

3. **Growth Trajectory**: Lima shows strong positive growth across SKUs while Helsinki is declining.

4. **Cluster Alignment & Regional Fit** (Category D): Lima shows excellent alignment with its cluster and region (9.60), while Helsinki has zero alignment.

5. **Category Management**: Lima's greater number of green flag SKUs and fewer red flags indicate better category management decisions.

## Recommendations for Underperforming Locations

For locations with similar market volume but poor performance like Helsinki:

1. **Conduct SKU Portfolio Rationalization**: Replace underperforming SKUs with proven performers from successful locations with similar passenger profiles.

2. **Examine Cluster Compatibility**: Reclassify location to better match regional product preferences.

3. **Focus on Category B Improvement**: Address segment coverage gaps and competitive product selection.

4. **Premium Product Mix**: Improve margins through introduction of higher-margin SKUs.

5. **Monitor and Remove Red Flag SKUs**: Implement a monthly tracking system for SKU performance.

This comparison clearly demonstrates that total market size is not the determining factor in portfolio performance - it's the strategic selection and management of products that drives success.
